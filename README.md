BACKGROUND:
IPET is an experiment that aim to assess whether the prosocial simulation effect (PSE) (i.e., imagine helping a person will lead to an increase in willingness to help him/her) can be extended to trusting the person they imagined. The following research questions were assess:
1. Replication the PSE in willingness to help.
2. Extend PSE to truts.
3. Assess whether vividness of the simulated events plays a modulating role in PSE in willingness to help and trust. 
4. Examine whether Perspective taking mediate the PSE effect in willingness to help.
5. Examine whether willingness to help mediate the PSE effect in trust.
6. Assess whether participant level emotion reaction modulated the PSE in willingness to help (exploratory)
7. Bayesian cumulative mixed model replication of questions 1-3.

IPET_analysis.rmd contains scripts for analyses in IPET. A list of measures collected from the experiments are included in IPET_analysis.rmd. In addition, Bayes_scripts.R and LMM_scripts.R can be found IPE_IPEF_Analysis folder.
